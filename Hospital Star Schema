# Hospital Star Schema Data Model

## Overview

This repository contains the star schema data model designed for a hospital management system. The model is structured to facilitate efficient querying and reporting of hospital visits, treatments, and patient information.

- **Department_ID**: Foreign key linking to the Department dimension
- **Date_ID**: Foreign key linking to the Date dimension
- **Treatment_ID**: Foreign key linking to the Treatment dimension
- **Diagnosis_ID**: Foreign key linking to the Diagnosis dimension
- **Cost**: Total cost of the visit
- **Duration**: Length of stay (in hours/days)
- **Payment_Method**: Method of payment (e.g., Cash, Insurance)
